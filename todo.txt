SRGUI Todo List
-----------------

	1. continue rearranging headers (this started as a single h/cpp pair)
	2. add some helper functions for duplication that's appearing (eg setParentDirty, setArea)
	3. maybe even fit size to text extents function
	4. design srRadioGroup & srRadioBox.
	(somewhere in here textfields, window resizing, caption buttons, and so much more)

Notes
-------

	* still need to have a look at layout managing.
	   - some kind necessary for controls that can change shape in a way
	     that moves other controls around (like Dear ImGui's Collapsing Header)

	* should look into menu bar object layout
		^ how to implement menus is going to be tricky. 
		- a srMenuBar contains basically a list of srMenu.
		- srMenu has a surface like a srWindow and can redraw on changing item attributes
		- all access to items is through the srMenu.
			^- there is NO srMenuItem
		- thru srMenu an item can be given an action (display submenu, un/checked, funcall)
		- srMenu is quite like a srWindow that will never move and only contains stacked 
			selectable items.
