SRGUI Todo List
-----------------

	1. test mouse down/move/up events by implementing horizontal scrollbar
		 and attaching it to text field in the demo.
	2. started menus, might as well get them working
	3. add a callback and have the demo use SDL2's textinput event instead of raw keypress
	4. full text area?
