SRGUI Todo List
-----------------

	1. move composite control rendering into srWindow (cleaner and also fixes 5)
	2. textfield arrow keys, shift, auto-scrolling from cursor movement.
	3. provide extra constructors (size from text, default sizes, etc)
	4. start menus?
	5. fix drawing-while-focus issues in composite controls

Notes
-------

	*  layout managers.
	   - some kind necessary for controls that can change shape in a way
	     that moves other controls around (like Dear ImGui's Collapsing Header)
	   - also affected by resize (especially controls that should stay relative
			 to border, like caption decorator buttons)

	* menu bar object layout
		^ how to implement menus is going to be tricky. 
		- a srMenuBar contains basically a list of srMenu.
		- srMenu has a surface like a srWindow and can redraw on changing item attributes
		- all access to items is through the srMenu.
			^- there is NO srMenuItem
		- thru srMenu an item can be given an action (display submenu, un/checked, funcall)
		- srMenu is quite like a srWindow that will never move and only contains stacked 
			selectable items.
