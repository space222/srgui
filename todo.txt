SRGUI Todo List
-----------------

	1. provide extra constructors (size from text, default sizes, etc)
	2. enter/lose focus events, use SDL2's textinput event instead of raw keypress
	3. mouse down/move/up events needed for scroll bar
	4. full text field?
	5. start menus?

Notes
-------

	*  layout managers.
	   - some kind necessary for controls that can change shape in a way
	     that moves other controls around (like Dear ImGui's Collapsing Header)
	   - also affected by resize (especially controls that should stay relative
			 to border, like caption decorator buttons)

	* menu bar object layout
		^ how to implement menus is going to be tricky. 
		- a srMenuBar contains basically a list of srMenu.
		- srMenu has a surface like a srWindow and can redraw on changing item attributes
		- all access to items is through the srMenu.
			^- there is NO srMenuItem
		- thru srMenu an item can be given an action (display submenu, un/checked, funcall)
		- srMenu is quite like a srWindow that will never move and only contains stacked 
			selectable items.
